# Python-Matplotlib-Pyber
This program uses the Matplotlib library to analyze trip data for a fictional rideshare company.

In this program, city type (meaning either urban, suburban, or rural) is the independent variable, a variety of trip attributes are measured as potential dependent variables, and units of analysis include trips, drivers, and cities. The program organizes and plots the data using Pandas and Matplotlib. The entire program is organized using a Jupyter notebook.

Analysis of the program's output provides users with a few key findings. First, trips in cities classified as urban account for the vast majority of trips, along with the majority of drivers and fare revenues. Second, fares tend to be lowest in urban-type cities and highest in rural-type cities. Third, the average fares of cities are inversely correlated with their ride counts.Included below are a subset of the program's graphic outputs:
